Title: Lockers

UTACM rents out lockers in the 1st and 3rd floor of GDC to students on an annual
basis. You can request a locker [here][form]. After requesting a locker, you
should receive an email informing you on which locker you have been assigned
within a few days.

## Cost

Lockers are free for paid UTACM members or $5 for non-members per year. If you
desire a larger locker, there is an additional $5 fee.  To pay, visit our office
(GDC 3.304) and have an officer deposit your money in the cash box and email [VP
Internal][vp-email] to confirm your payment. Alternately, pay our VP Internal
directly.

If you pay and decide to join UTACM later that year, $5 locker fee can go
towards your membership dues.

## Rental Duration

Lockers are checked out per year, including the following summer. Locks must be
removed at the beginning of the following fall semester (or upon graduation),
else they are subject to being cut. Non-perishable contents of the locker will
be retained for a month, after which they may be trashed, given away, etc.

## Problems

If the locker you have been assigned to has someone else's lock on it, email <a

removed. A warning will then go up on this locker for a couple days, and if it
isn't heeded, the lock will be cut. Be sure to alert if the offending lock is
removed and replaced with your own, lest yours be cut by mistake.
