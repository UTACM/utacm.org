## What is ACM?

The Association for Computing Machinery is a student chapter of the national
[ACM][acm] at the University of Texas at Austin, and exists to create a
community among Computer Science students and anyone interested in technology.

The ACM holds a wide range of social, professional, academic, and service events
each semester. Primary events of the ACM include our annual Big Event (a
barbecue and student/faculty mixer), faculty lectures, company nights, LAN
parties, programming contests, and the general meeting.

Smaller, more irregular events include: movie nights, bowling nights, paintball,
laser tag, tubing, broomball, and camping.  There are also a few officer-only
events.
