Summary: Start the new year with a LAN Party!

Welcome back from your (hopefully) great summer! And what's a better way to
start a new year than a LAN Party!

Bring your PC and your favorite games and join the others. Or just come to sing
your heart out/pretending to be an awesome rockstar in Rock Band. Or join an
epic Super Smash Bros. fight. We have Xbox 360, Wii and other consoles with
games for you to enjoy (feel free to bring your own games also). What's more:
there will be free sodas and pizzas! What's not to like?

FREE for paid members, $10 for non-members, $0 for new members who pay dues
($20) that night.
